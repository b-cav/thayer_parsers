Here are 3 self-contained bug files. However, I believe that they may
all be the same bug in different guises.

All 3 parsers work with PB_MIN, but fail with PB_LALR.
See the constant BKEND to change between the two.

bug1.c uses:

  H_RULE(int8range, h_int_range(h_int8(), -1, 1));


bug2.c uses:

  /* parse a single int16 between the values of -2 and 1 */
	H_RULE(bigint16, h_with_endianness(BYTE_BIG_ENDIAN,h_int16()));
	H_RULE(int16range, h_int_range(bigint16,-2,1));

bug3.c uses:

  /* parse a single int16 between the values of -2 and 1 */
  H_RULE(littleint16, h_with_endianness(BYTE_LITTLE_ENDIAN,h_int16()));
	H_RULE(int16range, h_int_range(littleint16,-2,1));
