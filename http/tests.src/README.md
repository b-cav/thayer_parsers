# Tests

## Description:
This directory contains a python script that generates passing and failing http tests as well as the programs that automatically generate such tests.
Currently generates ~500 passing requests and responses and a corresponding failure for each.
A smaller, but representative, suite of tests are written to the `../tests/` directory.
Failure tests are generated by changing a single field of a passing test (ususlly towards the end) to an invalid equivalent of that field.

## Usage:

* `./tv.sh` removes all present tests and runs `tv.py` to generate a new slate of tests
